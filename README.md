# Laravel Inertia React tech stack - Dockerized
Quick setup for a laravel 12 + Inertia + React stack, built with Laravel Breeze. The setup uses docker containers for the development and production environment, and contains a production-ready container which uses volumes, and a local container which uses bindmounts for instant reflection of host system code changes.
